Animation
=========
Man, screw AnimationPlayer

AnimationPlayer holds the Animations. To set the animations based on an AnimatedSprite2D, 
You must click the AnimatedSprite2D, click "Animation" tab at the bottom, and then you 
will see the keyframe symbol by animation. I currently set the animation and the frames, 
but you can set an AnimationPlayer CallMethod Track and set AnimatedSprite2D.playing to true
at time=0 instead.

AnimationTree determines animation state within your AnimationPlayer. The Tree is purely for state decisions.
This allows you to use the same tree (copied) across different scenes that have different animations but the
same animation groups (IDLE, WALK, etc.)

When using "Advance Expressions", set transitions.advance.mode to Auto. The advance expression will 
determine what state to play, and code should set the blend positions. This decouples the if-else logic
for states + travel from code.

Colors
======
Godot color constants: 
	https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_color.html#constants


Zones
=====
(Not using zones anymore, now shards)
A base zone is a zone with only a primary element
An upgraded zone is a zone with a primary and secondary element
4 conditions
	Base zone -> same element = nothing
	Base zone -> new element = upgrade
	Upgraded zone -> child elements = buff
	Upgraded zone -> new element = nothing
	
Ability Manager
===============
The ability manager handles the interactions between specific abilities and the player. 
The interaction between abilities and the player's state happens through signals.
When the player does an action, the state machine requests the ability manager to trigger the 
corresponding action. If the action is viable, then it begins and a signal is emitted.
The player only changes state if this signal is read. 

## Benefits
- State machine reacts to abilities, doesn't control them
- No "stuck state" bug possible (can't transition without signal)
- Abilities are authoritative about their own readiness
- Loose coupling via signals
